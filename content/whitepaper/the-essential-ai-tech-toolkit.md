Mastering software engineering empowers practical ***Artificial Intelligence (AI)*** utilisation, as it fundamentally relies on software code; selecting the ***suitable AI technology stack*** is vital for business and productivity automation.

Understanding AI's underlying algorithms and data structures is essential for creating robust and efficient solutions. Developers and SMEs can leverage this ***knowledge to develop bespoke AI*** applications that can significantly boost operational efficiency and drive innovation.

A typical business stack for a ***small services-based business*** would look like this:

```
# Mini-Chat-CRM System for Dental Surgeons powered by AI.
# Functions: 
# - Inform and educate patients.
# - Facilitate patient onboarding.
# - Schedule appointments.
# - Enable chat for queries and support.
# - Send updates and notifications.
# - Process payments.
# Communication: Supports multiple channels (at least two).

```

Software engineering comprises ***three components: software environment, business stack, and code.*** Similarily, a good developer would analyse at least three contrasting technology stacks to introduce ***AI-driven automation.***

A ***typical technology stack for a small services-based business*** would look like this:
